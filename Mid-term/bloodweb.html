            <h3>Some specifics</h3>
            <p>
                 As you progress and collect blood points you gain access to more of the circles starting of with the inner circle which is generally the door way to the outer circles and it is said to be impossible to get an identical bloodweb to someone else. As you progress through the levels more and more nodes open up until you reach level 50 for the character and once that level is reach you can prestige and start the cycle of collecting blood point again and getting more items, perk, etc.
