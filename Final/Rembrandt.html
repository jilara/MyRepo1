                            Born in Leiden, Netherlands, in 1606, Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn attended elementary school from 1612 to 1616, and then attended the Latin School in Leiden, where he partook in biblical studies and lessons on the classics. From 1620 to either 1624 or 1625, Rembrandt trained as an artist under two masters. His first was painter Jacob van Swanenburgh (1571–1638), with whom he studied for about three years. Under van Swanenburgh, Rembrandt would have learned basic artistic skills.Rembrandt's second teacher was Amsterdam’s Pieter Lastman (1583–1633), who was a well-known history painter and likely helped Rembrandt master the genre, which included placing figures from biblical, historical and allegorical scenes in complex settings.

                            In 1625, Rembrandt settled back in Leiden, now a master in his own right, and over the next six years, he laid the foundations for his life's work. It was during this time that Lastman's influence was most noticeable, as in several instances Rembrandt deconstructed his former master's compositions and reassembled them into his own, a practice carried on by Rembrandt's own pupils later on.Rembrandt also worked on his first etchings (1626) in Leiden, and his eventual international fame would rely on the widespread dissemination of these works. Diverging from his contemporaries, Rembrandt endowed his etchings with a painterly quality achieved through suggestive handling of light and dark. In this vein, in 1629, Rembrandt completed Judas Repentant and Returning the Pieces of Silver, among others, works that further evidence his interest in the handling of light. Another example is his Peter and Paul Disputing (1628), in which the painting’s lighted elements are clustered together and surrounded by clusters of darker tones, drawing the viewer's eye to a general focal point before moving in to observe the details within.Rembrandt began to do business in 1631 with Hendrick Uylenburgh, an Amsterdam entrepreneur who had a workshop that created portraits and restored paintings, among other activities. In the 10 years following the unveiling of The Night Watch, Rembrandt's overall artistic output diminished drastically and he produced no painted portraits; either he received no portrait commissions or he stopped accepting such commissions.

                            Speculation about what happened after The Night Watch has contributed to the "Rembrandt myth," according to which the artist became largely misunderstood and was ignored. Often blamed for Rembrandt's supposed downfall are the death of his wife and the supposed rejection of The Night Watch by those who commissioned it. But modern research has found no evidence that the painting was rejected or that Rembrandt experienced deep devastation upon his wife's death. Having sold his house in 1658, Rembrandt rented a house on the Rozengracht. In 1660 a contract was drawn up between Rembrandt, his son, Titus, and Hendrickje Stoffels. This was designed to protect Rembrandt from his creditors and to enable him to continue working. The agreement entailed that Rembrandt should “give aid and assistance” to the other two parties, and then it stipulated that “[Rembrandt] would live with them, receive free board, and be exempt from housekeeping expenses and rent on condition that he will aid the partners in every respect to the extent possible, and promote the business.” In reality, Rembrandt now worked in the service of his son and his common-law wife, as the agreement continued: “Having been granted some time ago cessio bonorum conveyance of goods, the reason why he has given up everything and has to be supported.” Shortly before his death Rembrandt was preparing a number of copperplates for an etched Passion, commissioned by the Amsterdam art lover Dirck Cattenburgh. He did not finish this project.
