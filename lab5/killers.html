            <h2>Who are these killers?</h2>
            <p>
                The killers also know as slayers are brought forth by the 'Entity' to stop the survivors from escaping. The 'Entity'gifts the killer with a higher speed and heightened senses and a power to find and sacrifice the survivors. The killers are also given special perks to boost their preformance when hunting the survivors. Each killer is given a story to their deeds and with each story comes a connection to their perks and powers showing that this is what they were made to do.

            <h3>My Choice</h3>
            <p>
                My choice for a killer would be Ghost Face as he has a power called Night shroud which allows him to hide making him undetectable. while undetectable he can stalk the survivors to mark them allowing a one hit when they are being chased. Also night shroud can give some thrilling juump scares when they sneak up to a survivor. His style is very suitable for sneaky and my preference in game.

            <h4>Who is Ghost Face?</h4>
            <p>His name is Jed Olsen, an outstanding and easy going guy that could appeal to those around him with ease making it possible for him to get a job at any small newspapers. Within a couple of months of being in the towns his acts would begin. ruthless to every target stalking and photographing as the prey went through their daily lives for a week or two before quietly breaking in and put an end to them. While working at the newspaper he enjoying writing his stories and interviewing the victims family. When he got bored of the town he would simply dissappear leaving a note stating along the lines of "I hope you liked my stories--I enjoyed bringing them to life. Don't worry, I'm not done." </p>
