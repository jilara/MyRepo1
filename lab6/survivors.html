            <h2>Who are these survivors</h2>
            <p>
                The survivors also known as campers as it shows them around a campfire pregame. Their goal is to escape and survive through the means of openning atleast one of two exit gates that have to be powered by generator which spawn throughout the map in need of repair and 5 are needed to be repaired to be able to open the gates. Another form of escape is the hatch which is most commonly used when all other survivors passed away. The survivors are also given perks that can speed certain things up when injured, give a boost of energy, highten senses, and allow the aura of the slayer to be seen after certain actions are done. Instead of having a power like the killers they have items which can be used to blind the killer, speed up repairing, open the natch, or heal others.

            <h3>My Choice</h3>
            <p>
                 My choice for a survivor is Feng Min while there is nothing really special about her, her perks are very beneficial in competitive game play. One perk that can make all the differnce in a generator targeted game is 'technician' allowing her to repair a generator with minimal noise making it difficult for the killer to notice and sometime overlook the generator. An other perk would be 'lithe' allowing a quick escape giving her time to plan her next move.

            <h3>Who is Feng Min?</h3>
            <p>At a young age she became a very competitve gamer at the start her parents thought it would be fine playing for a few minutes whcih then turned to hours and finally day. She became so competitve she started to forget her daily neccesities like food, sleep, and hygiene. Her parents started to disapprove of her action trying to encourage her to focus more on her studies but feeling ridiculed for her choices she left esentially living in pc cafes and lan partys creating a name for herself to soon be invited into a high class e-sports team. Over time the pressure started showing as she began to slip up and she started to spiral out of control till one day she woke in an unknown place accepting the challenge of surviving beliving that this was what she trained for her whole life.  </p>
